# About Us

We are both engineering students who are passionate about the future of education.

I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering major at Olin College of Engineering.
I get a lot of satisfaction out of explaining complex subjects in simple terms.
In high school, I always wanted to know the logic behind something and roughly
how it worked, even if I did not have the knowledge for a full understanding.
I wanted to remove the black box around topics we were not supposed
to know or were supposed to assumed worked.

Contributions:
* Created the Zine format for this project - fonts, style, etc
* Wrote about the basics of Linear Algebra
  * Matrix Basics, Vectors, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.
* Wrote about how SVD works on an image
* Code and Implementation Examples
* MatLab, Python, and WolframAlpha examples

I am an Engineering with Design major at Olin College of Engineering. I was drawn to this project
because I wanted to help get high school students excited about what they are
learning - especially in regards to math.

I did well in High School, but I always felt a disconnection from what I was
learning. I always wanted to see the greater purpose of something I was learning,
this project gave me the opportunity to do so.

Contributions:
* Wrote about the SVD in detail
  * Mathematical interpretations, data analysis
* Wrote about Symmetric Matrices
* Wrote the project proposals
* Created the educational videos
