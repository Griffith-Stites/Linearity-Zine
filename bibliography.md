3Blue1Brown’s Youtube videos are often cited as an intuitive, visual explanation of complicated mathematical concepts. One of the most important prerequisites to understanding the SVD, particularly through the lens of eigendecomposition, are eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This video also discusses eigenbases, which are key to understanding why we choose to decompose matrices in the first place.

Leskovec’s approach to SVD begins with some of the concepts students may be familiar with, but quickly moves into interpreting the matrices in terms of the data they represent. In particular, the example he gives later on involving movie reviews and users helped cement the often-nebulous idea of using SVD for pattern analysis.

[Gilbert Strang on SVD @ MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBcLRGuAFUk)

Strang’s lecture calls attention to the intuitive understanding of the SVD as a series of matrix transformations: rotations and scaling. He also connects the SVD to eigendecomposition, which we use as a key to the mathematical interpretation of SVD.

We talk about Principal Component Analysis in the application of SVD. Referencing a video that focuses on the analytical aspect outside of the complications of the SVD’s mathematics helped us understand how we analyze data better.

In working to create an easy-to-understand Python code for the SVD, we had to do a significant amount of research into the individual functions that allow it to be possible. While existing SVD code exists in Python, very little of it is intuitive for readers to follow.
