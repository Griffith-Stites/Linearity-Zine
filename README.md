# SVD Zine

An educational zine (mini booklet) explaining basic linearity concepts and the Singular Value Decomposition.

This booklet is aimed at high school students with an algebra understanding. The booklet is meant to give students excitement in regards to math, by showing them the purpose of some of the things they are learning. It is also meant to explain the logic behind the Singular Value Decomposition to help remove the "black box" aspect that is often present when using tools such as MATLAB or other programming tools that rely on the Singular Value Decomposition.

### Files
We have example code for implementing the SVD in MATLAB and Python, you can get that
code by cloning or downloading this repository [here](https://github.com/Griffith-Stites/Linearity-Zine).
The code is in the code folder.

See  our proposal draft [here](https://www.griffithstites.com/Linearity-Zine/proposal_draft).
