# SVD Zine

An educational zine (mini booklet) explaining basic linearity concepts and the Singular Value Decomposition.

This booklet is aimed at high school students with an algebra understanding. It is meant to give students excitement in regards to math, by showing them the purpose of some of the things they are learning. It is also meant to explain the logic behind the Singular Value Decomposition to help remove the "black box" aspect that is often present when using tools such as MATLAB or other programming tools where you can use the Singular Value Decomposition without really understanding it.

See the SVD zine [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f3B-3JfkpM2tV1ZQEj0xgGliBr8aZgAKX4s3_78mlkg/edit?usp=sharing).

See a preliminary zine going over the basics of Linear Algebra needed for SVD [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1navVaTZNK-ppvdtgwaIFQmDgSO_vroboGFzWJHKjndQ/edit?usp=sharing). This is a resource designed to give students with little prior knowledge of Linear Algebra the tools to understand our SVD zine.

### Files
We have example code for implementing the SVD in MATLAB and Python, you can get that
code by cloning or downloading this repository [here](https://github.com/Griffith-Stites/Linearity-Zine).
The code is in the code folder.

See  our proposal draft [here](https://www.griffithstites.com/Linearity-Zine/proposal_draft).
