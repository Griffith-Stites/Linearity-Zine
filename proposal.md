# Project Proposal

Our project is a host of educational resources to help students better understand the Singular Value Decomposition. Our goal is to make the concepts behind the SVD more accessible and eliminate the technicalities that frequently hinder other explanations. We are formatting our project mainly as two zines, or a DIY books, that can be printed at home and distributed to students either as supplemental material or as an introductory reading assignment. We are also publishing these on a website that includes supplemental material and videos that go over the same ideas as the zine.

The SVD is a key concept in linear algebra, yet many linear algebra students fail to understand it even when they have knowledge of its individual components. Meanwhile, students in high school algebra courses are often introduced to linear algebra concepts without knowing why they matter. Our first zine is an introduction to the linear algebra concepts necessary to understand the SVD, designed to be accessible for high school algebra students. Our second zine dives into the conceptual and mathematical understanding of the SVD, including examples of code and applications.

We have to balance the depth of our information with its accessibility. We want to front-load the logic behind the SVD, rather than start with mathematical proofs. Many students find that a more abstract or logic-based discussion of math concepts is more accessible than a symbolic, proof-based one. By beginning with this abstraction, we believe students will have an easier time following along with the more specific mathematical concepts. Our zines will not necessarily be a resource for being able to do SVD problems by hand (oof!), but a resource for understanding how programs like MATLAB perform it and why it matters. We do, however, want to provide math-minded students with the resources to further explore the depths of the SVD and all the math that makes it possible.

We don’t want our zines to look or feel like a math paper or textbook. We want to make sure that students don’t feel discouraged just by looking at it. We are exploring different methods of organizing information to make it more approachable and to inspire further inquiry rather than stifle it. By setting clear learning goals in section headings, beginning with abstractions and images, and moving into specific technical ideas, we hope to bring an understanding of the SVD to more students.

3Blue1Brown’s Youtube videos are often cited as an intuitive, visual explanation of complicated mathematical concepts. One of the most important prerequisites to understanding the SVD, particularly through the lens of eigendecomposition, are eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This video also discusses eigenbases, which are key to understanding why we choose to decompose matrices in the first place.

[Jure Leskovec on SVD @ Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5mlg91as1c)

Leskovec’s approach to SVD begins with some of the concepts students may be familiar with, but quickly moves into interpreting the matrices in terms of the data they represent. In particular, the example he gives later on involving movie reviews and users helped cement the often-nebulous idea of using SVD for pattern analysis.

[Gilbert Strang on SVD @ MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBcLRGuAFUk)

Strang’s lecture calls attention to the intuitive understanding of the SVD as a series of matrix transformations: rotations and scaling. He also connects the SVD to eigendecomposition, which we use as a key to the mathematical interpretation of SVD.

[Daniel Connolly and Cassandra Overney on PCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPo0EyiS3Fs)

We talk about Principal Component Analysis in the application of SVD. Referencing a video that focuses on the analytical aspect outside of the complications of the SVD’s mathematics helped us understand how we analyze data better.

[NumPy Linear Algebra Documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/)

In working to create an easy-to-understand Python code for the SVD, we had to do a significant amount of research into the individual functions that allow it to be possible. While existing SVD code exists in Python, very little of it is intuitive for readers to follow.
